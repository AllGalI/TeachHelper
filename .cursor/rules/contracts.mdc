When updating or creating API documentation in `api.md`:
  - Clearly describe the expected response for each route.
  - Document required request data for `body` and `params`. 
  - Extract details for `body` and `params` strictly from Pydantic schemas if they are available; do not document these if schemas are missing.
  - Explicitly specify the data types required for the request and the data types returned in the response.
